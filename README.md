# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
 
## Overview of Analysis
The task here was to determine the quantity of employees who are retiring, their titles, and to identify the other employees eligible for mentorship programs. The first table includes employee numbers, first name, last name, position, and start and end date. The second table includes employee number, first and last name, birth date, position title, and start and end date.

## Results
There are four key takeaways from our analysis:
1.) About 43% of retiring employees are either Senior Staff or Senior engineers, meaning a lot of institutional knowledge is about to leave.
2.) To this end, a priority should be placed on either directly replacing Senior position with new hires or looking for promotions from within the company.
3.) There are only 1,550 retiring employees who are eligible for the mentorship program.
4.) The number of people retiring far out stretches the number of eligible mentors. This means that the company needs a much better program to train people within the company.

## Summary
The so-called “silver tsunami” will come suddenly, however we can also project how many employees will be retiring in each year. Thus Pewlett-Hackard could further breakdown the annual turnover rate for employees and work to replace them in the year in which they are retiring. A one-in-one-out system, so to speak. 

Additionally, there are not enough mentors for the number of new employees showing up. Along with the above one-in-one-out policy, any person tagged for promotion should be matched with a mentor immediately, so that they can glean as much institutional knowledge as possible before retirees start leaving. Otherwise, consultant positions could be created those new retirees can be hired part-time to new hires or new promotions.
